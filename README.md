# WazHack Clone Project

![Waz Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/averytorres/WazHack-Clone/master/menu_background.png)

Following the material from this site:
[roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/bz6s0j/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/)

This project will attempt to follow through the initial tutorial of building a roguelike, then build off of that information and create a clone to my favorite roguelike, WazHack.
